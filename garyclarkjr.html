<h1>CATFISH BLUES: TODAY</h1>

"There are very few people who have an awareness of how widespread this terrorism and violence was, and the way it now shapes the geography of the United States. We’ve got majority black cities in Detroit, Chicago, large black populations in Oakland and Cleveland and Los Angeles and Boston, and other cities in the Northeast. And the African Americans in these communities did not come as immigrants looking for economic opportunities, they came as refugees, exiles from lands in the South where they were being terrorized. And those communities have particular needs we’ve never addressed, we’ve never talked about. We’ve got generational poverty in these cities and marginalization within black communities, and you cannot understand these present-day challenges without understanding the Great Migration, and the terror and violence that sent the African Americans to these cities where they’ve never really been afforded the care and assistance they needed to recover from the terror and trauma that were there."

Since the circulation of Catfish Blues occurred during the time of the “migration” period in the early twentieth century, I shall analyze relationally the experience of black Americans fleeing violence and terror of the south with the present-day Syrian refugee crisis.  The experience of black Americans can be analyzed relationally in comparison to the Syrian refugee crisis in the present day.  As discussed in lecture, the experience of being designated as a “criminal” or “outlaw”, which black Americans and Syrian refugees experience, and not having a permanent home originated out of anti-black sentiments.  The experience of Syrian refugees is directly related to that of both chattel slavery and the prison industrial complex.  Christina Sharpe relates these experiences in In the Wake, and describes how the physical conditions migrants and refugees in the boats in the Mediterranean were very similar to the physical conditions that occurred in the slave ships in the Middle Passage.  Their bodies have been racialized to be cheap and disposable.
