# An aside:

Alright, yes, I admit, this is certainly not what I would consider elegantly structured web development on my end.  But, I got it done, its visually appealing, and the format of the Zine is unique among my classmates as most people chose to create a physical magazine.  This technically wasn't a web development project, this is an ethnic studies project.  So in that context, I'm really happy with the final product.  

Just wanted to explain in case future employer and/or Bill Gates ends up seeing this page ðŸ˜›
